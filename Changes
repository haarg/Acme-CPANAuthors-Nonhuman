          - author data is now generated using the 00whois.xml document,
            rather than 01mailrc.txt, to get non-asciified author names

          - use new Acme::CPANAuthors::Factory
          - fixed prereqs, to allow operation on 5.8.x (build requires is not

          - use utf8 pragma, in case some names contain unicode characters
          - include a bit of background to why I wrote this

          - rewrite code and HTML generation by using embedded templates in
            the .pm file and authors in __DATA__, and a custom Dist::Zilla
            plugin
          - updated list of PAUSE IDs, by re-scanning cpan-faces
